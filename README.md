# Recalculate - Redcap External Module

## What does it do?

Placeholder Text

## Installing

You can install the module from the REDCap EM repo or drop it directly in your modules folder (i.e. `redcap/modules/recalculate_v1.0.0`).

## Configuration

The module has no configuration, instead you should navigate to the dedicated module page, select an appropriate record, event, and field combination to trigger a recalcuation on them.

## Todo 

* Make sure we are really only looping over the requested fields
* Form width should be limited to avoid excess white space with some min width
* More testing
