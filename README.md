Placeholder Text

## Installing

You can install the module from the REDCap EM repo or drop it directly in your modules folder (i.e. `redcap/modules/recalculate_v1.0.0`).

## Configuration

The module has no configuration, instead you should navigate to the dedicated module page, select an appropriate record, event, and field combination to trigger a recalcuation on them.

## Todo 

* Is this really as fast as we can go?
